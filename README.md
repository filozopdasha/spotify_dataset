# Spotify Insights

Hi!
I’m a Software Engineering student and beginner developer.
Right now, I’m exploring data visualization and learning new tools for it.

This is a small but useful one-page data analytics app built with:
- React
- Flexmonster Pivot Table
- Highcharts

# Functionality

This project provides a simple and interactive way to explore Spotify’s Top 200 dataset using two data visualization tools: pivot tables and charts.

### Two Pivot Table Views
- 	Tracks View:
Displays track-level insights with artist names, track titles, and total stream counts.
-	Albums View:
Shows a breakdown by album and release year, including total streams and top artists.

Users can easily switch between these two views via a custom toolbar tab in the pivot table.

### Highcharts Integration
-	A column chart visualizes the most streamed artists based on the dataset.

# Result:
